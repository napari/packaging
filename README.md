## Description

This repository stores the tools (CI pipelines and helper scripts) needed to create **conda-based**
napari installers for Linux, macOS and Windows. It uses the [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor)
tool which allows [constructing an installer](https://conda.github.io/constructor/) for a collection
of conda packages.
